lager.python.executor - Python Script Executor

Handles direct execution of Python scripts within the container.
No longer uses docker exec - executes scripts directly since this service
now runs inside the Python container.

Originally migrated from gateway/controller/controller/application/views/run.py (legacy, removed)
Now performs direct execution to eliminate the controller container dependency.

# How long a starting job waits for the previous one to finish shutting down.
#
# Derived, not chosen. It has to cover the longest reap the box can legitimately
# perform, or the wait ends while the previous job is still being killed and the
# next one starts driving a bench that is still mid-teardown -- exactly the
# overlap the gate exists to prevent. That bound is the full escalation:
# cleanup up to CLEANUP_MAX_S, then TERMINATE_GRACE_S for SIGTERM and again for
# SIGKILL.
#
# It was a flat 15.0 when the escalation was bounded by a fixed 3s cleanup grace
# (7s worst case, comfortably covered). The progress watchdog took the worst case
# to 64s and left this behind, which silently reopened the overlap for any
# cleanup running longer than 15s. Deriving it means that cannot happen again.
#
# Reaching this ceiling still means a job is wedged rather than cleaning up, and
# we proceed with a warning: an indefinite block would turn one stuck script into
# a permanently unusable box.

def _wrap_with_timeout(command, timeout, detach):
    """Wrap a job's argv in /usr/bin/timeout, or return it unchanged.

    Pure: no processes, no filesystem. Extracted from ``execute`` so the
    contract can be asserted without standing up a job -- what the deadline
    is, what happens when it passes, and when the wrapper is absent.

    ``--kill-after`` is what makes the deadline enforceable. GNU timeout sends
    SIGTERM at the deadline and nothing more, so a script that never returns
    from it never dies: one blocked in an uninterruptible call (a
    pyvisa/libusb/serial read -- the normal case on a box) or one that installs
    its own SIGTERM handler runs on until something else kills it.
    ``lager python --timeout 3`` against a 30-second sleep was measured still
    running 17 minutes later, ended by a CI step timeout rather than by the
    timeout it was given. Measured against coreutils 9.1 with the grace in
    place, the same script exits at deadline+grace with 137 --
    ``SIGKILL_EXIT_CODE``, which the CLI has always had a message for and could
    never reach.

    The grace window is ``CLEANUP_GRACE_S``, matching the SIGTERM->SIGKILL
    escalation ``_signal_and_reap`` already applies, so a job is escalated the
    same way however it is being stopped. Longer would let a wedged job hold
    the bench past the point ``QUIESCE_WAIT_S`` assumes it has been reaped.

    What the grace does NOT buy is a script's own ``finally``. Measured against
    coreutils 9.1 and CPython 3: SIGTERM's default disposition terminates the
    interpreter outright, so a ``try/finally`` around the work does not unwind
    on this path -- and did not before this change either. (``_signal_targets``
    reasons carefully about truncating cleanup, but that is about SIGINT, which
    CPython does raise as ``KeyboardInterrupt``; ``timeout`` sends SIGTERM.) So
    the grace is what it looks like -- a wait before force-killing -- and it
    matters for the two cases that outlive SIGTERM: a script that installs its
    own handler, and one wedged in an uninterruptible call where no grace
    length would have helped.

    Making the deadline run bench teardown would mean sending SIGINT instead
    (``timeout --signal=INT``), which changes the exit code a script can report
    and is a larger behavioural change than the deadline not working.

    Args:
        command: the job's argv
        timeout: requested seconds; 0 means no limit. Values above
            MAX_TIMEOUT are capped to it, with a warning -- the cap used to be
            a silent ``min()``, so a job asking for 600s ran 300 and nothing
            said so, which reads as the timeout firing early rather than as a
            ceiling being applied.
        detach: detached jobs are not wrapped. The wrapper would become the
            group leader ``_signal_targets`` reasons about, and detached jobs
            are torn down through a different path (``start_new_session``,
            ``_kill_by_proc_id``). ``--timeout`` therefore does not apply to
            ``-d``, which is worth saying rather than leaving to be discovered.

    Returns:
        The argv to execute.

    Reduce a job's PIDs to the ones that must be signalled directly.

    A non-detached job runs under /usr/bin/timeout, which puts itself and the
    script in a fresh process group and forwards SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP to it.
    Signalling the group leader therefore already reaches every member.

    Signalling the members as well does not merely duplicate harmlessly.
    Measured against GNU coreutils 9.7: signalling wrapper and script together
    delivers SIGINT to the script twice, and the second one lands inside the
    `finally` that is unwinding from the first, raises out of it, and
    truncates the cleanup after roughly one step. Signalling either alone
    delivers exactly once and the cleanup completes. One signal per process
    group is the whole point of this function.

    Two things are deliberately still signalled directly:

    * Everything, when ``sig`` is SIGKILL. It cannot be caught, so nothing
      forwards it and every PID has to be named. There is no cleanup to
      truncate in that case either.
    * Any member whose group leader is not part of this job, or is no longer
      alive to do the forwarding — a grandchild that called setsid(), or a
      wrapper that has already exited.

    Whatever is signalled, the wait covers every PID in the job and runs once
