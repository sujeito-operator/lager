# setup_and_deploy_box.sh
# One-command setup and deployment for Lager boxes
#
# This script handles the complete box setup process:
#   1. SSH key configuration (passwordless access)
#   2. Sudo configuration (passwordless udev management)
#   3. Box code deployment (git sparse-checkout via HTTPS)
#   4. J-Link installation (optional, if available)
#   5. Docker container startup
#   6. Post-deployment verification
#
# Uses HTTPS for git operations (no authentication needed for public repo).
#
# Usage: ./setup_and_deploy_box.sh <box-ip> [OPTIONS]
#
# Options:
#   --user <username>     Box username (default: lagerdata)
#   --version <version>   Release tag (e.g. v0.15.0) or git branch to deploy (default: main)
#   --skip-jlink          Skip J-Link installation even if available
#   --skip-verify         Skip post-deployment verification
#   --help                Show this help message
#
# Examples:
#   ./setup_and_deploy_box.sh <BOX_IP>
#   ./setup_and_deploy_box.sh <BOX_IP> --version staging
#   ./setup_and_deploy_box.sh <BOX_IP> --version v0.15.0

# yet they would prompt for the box password every single time (the "entered it
# ~10 times" symptom). Installing the lager_box key and SSH config entry up
# front means exactly ONE password prompt for the whole install; everything
# after is key-based.

# filenames, so without an explicit -i it is never tried — and on a box where
# it is the only authorized key, every command in this script fails. Empty
# means "offer ssh's own defaults", which is what a box authorized by the
# operator's own key needs: -i REPLACES the default identity list rather than
# adding to it, so an unconditional -i would lock such a box out.

# connectivity check) this test rides the already-authenticated connection
# and false-positives, so key setup is silently skipped and every later
# BatchMode operation (`lager update`, probes) fails with "Permission
# denied". Force a genuinely fresh connection so the test exercises key
# authentication for real.
# Ask the box whether the lager_box key is in its authorized_keys.

# NOT "can this machine reach the box" — those differ whenever the operator
# has a key of their own, and an ssh_config `Host *` IdentityFile gives one
# for EVERY host. This step used to ask the second question in place of the

# =============================================================================
# STEP 2: Sudo Configuration
#
# MUST run here, right after SSH key setup and before the git/docker/DNS/
# firewall steps below: each of those uses `sudo`, so on a box whose login user
# lacks broad passwordless sudo they would each prompt for the sudo password (the
# extra prompts on a fresh install). Writing this NOPASSWD sudoers file first
# means one sudo prompt here, and every privileged step afterward is passwordless.
#
# THESE GRANTS MAKE ${BOX_USER} ROOT-EQUIVALENT, BY DESIGN. The list below is
# long and specific, which makes it look confined. It is not, and it cannot be
# made so by narrowing entries, because provisioning a box requires root:
#
#   - deploying udev rules is root by construction. The cp+reload pair below
#     is the whole point of this file, and udev runs commands as root via
#     RUN+=, so anyone who can write a rules file and reload it has root.
#   - the firewall grants install a script from world-writable /tmp to a
#     root-owned path and then run it. The root-owned destination stops a
#     LATER edit by another user; it does not stop the login user from
#     putting arbitrary content there in the first place.
#   - the box-config file (see _host_ops.boxcfg_sudoers_rules) grants
#     apt-get, which runs arbitrary commands as root through its own config.
#
# So: treat anyone holding the ${BOX_USER} SSH key as holding root on this
# box. Scoping individual entries here is blast-radius hygiene and an aid to
# reading the file -- worth doing, but do not describe it as containment.
# Real containment means replacing the three paths above with fixed
# root-owned wrapper scripts the login user cannot edit.

# box can invoke `lager` locally. Non-fatal: the box works without it.
#
# Mirrors host_cli_install_cmd() in cli/commands/utility/_host_cli.py — keep
