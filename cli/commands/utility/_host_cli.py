"""
Host-OS lager CLI install, shared between `lager install` and `lager update`.

Both flows install the CLI onto the box's host OS (outside docker) so a
self-hosted CI runner on the box can invoke `lager` locally, and keep it
version-matched to the deployed box code. The install source is the box's own
checkout (`~/box/cli`, materialized via cone-mode `git sparse-checkout add
cli`), not PyPI: branch and RC deploys have no PyPI release, and installing
from the checkout guarantees the host CLI matches the deployed ref exactly.

The install target is a dedicated venv at `~/.lager_venv` with the `lager`
entry point symlinked into `~/.local/bin`.

It is deliberately NOT under `~/.lager`: that path is the CLI's own global
config *file* (`config.DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME`, and the box registry that
`box_storage` keeps beside it). v0.32.6 through v0.38.0 installed to
`~/.lager/venv`, so the two collided on one name -- one wanting a file, the
other a directory -- and whichever ran first broke the other:

  * host CLI first -> `~/.lager` is a directory, the venv works, and the host
    CLI can no longer read or write its own config or box registry
    (`IsADirectoryError`). Worse than not installing it at all, because it runs
    but cannot keep state.
  * anyone runs `lager` on the host first -> `~/.lager` is a config file, and
    `python3 -m venv "$HOME/.lager/venv"` fails for the rest of time with
    `[Errno 20] Not a directory` -- reported, until this change, as "is the
    python3-venv package installed?" on hosts where it was installed and
    working.

`~/.lager_venv` follows the convention every other piece of host-side lager
state already uses: a sibling with a `.lager_` prefix (`~/.lager_update_check`,
`~/.lager_gateway_auth`).

A venv sidesteps PEP 668
(`externally-managed-environment` on Ubuntu 23.04+/Debian 12+, where a plain
`pip3 install --user` fails outright), works on hosts with no pip3 at all,
and keeps the CLI's dependencies out of the system Python. Creating a venv
needs a working `ensurepip`, which on Debian/Ubuntu means the `python3-venv`
package — callers probe for it and install it through their existing
privileged-operation paths.

Pure logic: no SSH, no click. `lager update` uses these helpers directly;
`setup_and_deploy_box.sh` mirrors the install sequence in shell (it must stay
standalone-runnable). A drift-guard test in cli/tests/test_host_cli.py pins
the load-bearing literals in both scripts to this module.
