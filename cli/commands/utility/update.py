# --- Pre-built box image (GHCR) --------------------------------------------
#
# `.github/workflows/box-image-publish.yml` builds box.Dockerfile on every v*
# tag and pushes it to ghcr.io/lagerdata/lager-box. `lager update` prefers
# pulling that image over building it on the box, which costs 6+ minutes cold.
#
# The premise is that a CI-built image is interchangeable with a box-built one:
# everything box-specific -- PicoScope, SEGGER, /etc/lager, customer binaries,
# the cargo/npm volumes -- is bind-mounted by start_box.sh at `docker run`
# time, never COPY'd into the image. So the same Dockerfile at the same tag
# produces an equivalent image wherever it is built.
#
# EVERY failure on this path is a miss that falls back to the local build:
# branch targets, unpublished tags, an unreachable registry, a wrong-arch
# manifest, a missing or mismatched provenance label. That bias is deliberate
# and load-bearing. The local build is slow but has always produced something
# that runs; the new failure mode a pull introduces is a box that comes up
# FAST AND BROKEN, which on a customer box is strictly worse than slow. Never
# trade the second for the first.

    The published manifest is single-platform amd64 and is NOT a multi-arch

    explicit --platform, a non-amd64 host pulls the amd64 image anyway, tags it
    `lager`, and start_box.sh then dies with `exec format error`.

    This is defence in depth, not support for another architecture. A box is
    documented as x86-64 only (docs/source/getting-started/overview.mdx), and
    box.Dockerfile could not build anywhere else regardless -- the LabJack and
    nrfutil installers below are fetched from hardcoded x64 URLs with no arch
    branch. So the guard does not rescue a working arm box; it makes an
    unsupported host fail the way it always did (cleanly, at the build) instead
    of newly failing at container start with a confusing exec error. Cheap
    insurance against a wrong-arch tag from any source.

    `dpkg --print-architecture` stays unquoted so the box's shell expands it.

    Pulls through a THROWAWAY, empty docker config so the request goes out
    anonymously. The image is public, and inheriting the box's ambient
    credentials makes the pull depend on state that has nothing to do with
    this feature: a box that ever logged in to ghcr.io for something else
    sends those credentials, GHCR evaluates them against *this* repository
    rather than falling back to anonymous, and returns `denied: denied` for a
    package anyone can read. Observed exactly that on a workstation with
    credentials for a different ghcr.io org. The update still recovers -- the
    denial is classified and falls back to a build -- but the feature would
    silently stop helping that box for a reason unrelated to the image.

    Safe on a box because nothing here uses a docker *context*; the box talks
    to the default local socket, the same way start_box.sh's plain
    `docker build` does. The directory is removed even when the pull fails,

    Each top-level name that `box/` provides is *removed* from the root and

    already there. The old `cp -rf box/* .` was additive: it overwrote changed
    files but never removed ones the new tree no longer contained, so a file
    deleted upstream persisted on every box indefinitely and was baked into
    the runtime image by the next docker build. Boxes were found carrying
    modules deleted thirteen minor versions earlier, including the
    execute-capable MCP tools removed as a deliberate security reduction.
    Because `rm -rf box` then deleted the tracked source, the flattened tree
    was untracked and `git checkout -f` / `git reset --hard` had no authority
    over it — nothing else in the update path could ever clean it up.

    Invariants:

    - **`nullglob` is load-bearing.** Without it an unmatched `box/*` stays
      the literal string and `$name` becomes `*`. Every expansion here is
      also quoted, so even then `rm` would target a file literally named
      `*` rather than globbing, but the two guards together make an empty
      `box/` a no-op instead of an error.
    - **Removing before the move is what makes deletions propagate**, and it
      also stops `mv` from nesting `box/lager` *inside* an existing `lager/`
      (the classic `mv a b` behaviour when `b` is a directory).
    - **Only the names `box/` provides are touched.** A blanket wipe of `~/box`
      would take out `.git` and the root-level tracked files — root and `box/`
      both carry a `README.md` (see `_pull_shell_script`). `box/` ships no
      `cli` or `.git` entry, so the sparse-checked-out `~/box/cli` the host
      CLI install needs is never in range.
    - **`rmdir`, not `rm -rf`, retires the source directory.** It only
      succeeds once every entry has moved, so a partial flatten leaves `box/`
      intact and the next run recovers. `rm -rf box` here would destroy the
      source that a retry depends on.

    `mv` rather than `cp` because both sides are the same filesystem, making
    each entry an atomic rename: no disk doubling, and no window where a

    no `eval` needed. The `[ -n "$out" ]` gate is what makes the "empty

    `sort -z` is required for determinism: `find` walks in filesystem order,

    `_rebuild_gate_verdict` would rebuild.** It used to, in the single most
    expensive case — a box still on the `box/` subdir layout printed
    "Deps: cache valid (no rebuild) / Estimated: ~90s (cached build)"
    immediately before a ten-minute clean rebuild.

    Three distinct failures were behind that:

    * `needs_flatten` was ignored here, though the gate treats it as a
      definite rebuild trigger. The flatten moves every source file, and the
      build hash is over `sha256sum` output — which prints each path beside
      its digest — so a moved file necessarily changes it.
    * `_build_hash_mismatch` returns False both for "measured, unchanged"
      and for "could not measure", and this rendered both as "cache valid".
    * The only digest on hand was the *pre-pull* working tree's, so a forward
      jump whose current tree still matched the stored hash read as "cache
      valid" however much the target ref changed the image recipe.

    ``target_hash`` closes the third: the same aggregate digest, measured
    against the ref about to be checked out and read straight out of the
    object DB without a checkout (`_read_build_hash_at_ref`). When a pull is
    coming and that measurement succeeded it — not the working tree — is what
    the build will be keyed on, which also turns the old "older ref may
    differ" guess into a measured answer. An empty ``target_hash`` means the
    measurement failed (sparse checkout, odd ref) and the pre-pull tree is
    all there is; that is reported as unknown rather than as cache-valid.

    `unmeasured` deliberately does NOT imply a rebuild: the gate does not
    treat it as one either, so predicting one would over-estimate exactly as
    badly as the old text under-estimated. It only stops the preview

    # rebuild — redundant after a successful run and a common source of flaky
    # behavior. `hash_mismatch` participates here so the auto-invalidation
    # feature also fires on a deps-only change (Dockerfile/requirements moved
    # but code is in sync); previously this branch ignored the hash and the
    # rebuild silently never happened.
    #
    # Source state alone is not enough to declare success: an update that
    # failed after Step 8 (containers stopped and REMOVED) leaves a box that
    # reads as "in sync" here — git pulled fine, the stored hash predates the
    # failure — but has nothing running at all. Early-exiting then reports
    # success on a dead box, so the verdict also requires the lager container
    # to be running: 'container-down' falls through to the rebuild path below
    # and brings the box back up. `--force` still skips the early-exit
    # unconditionally.
    # Secret files must be owned by uid 33 (the container user), not merely
    # mode 0600. 0600 grants the owner alone, so a secrets file left under a
    # different owner — e.g. copied onto the box by hand — locks the runtime
    # out of it the moment anything tightens the mode. The symptom is silent:
    # secret injection returns empty and scripts fail nowhere near the cause.
    #
    # BEFORE the rebuild gate on purpose, like the host-CLI reconcile below.
    # This is a heal, not part of building an image, and the box that most
    # needs it is the one already running current code: an operator whose
    # secrets stopped working reaches for `lager update`, and if the repair
    # sat after the gate that update would early-exit "already up to date"
    # and fix nothing. Running it here costs one short SSH round-trip on the
    # fast path and makes the remedy work whenever it is reached for.
    #
    # `lager update` is the only path that runs with real privilege, so it is
