# Test Coverage

This document tracks what test coverage exists across all Lager features and the four test
suites: local unit tests, Python API tests, bash integration tests, and MCP tests.

**Counts here are checked against disk**, by `tools/check_coverage_counts.py` in the required
`static-checks` job — the gated run-counts below, the per-section file counts in every
`(-- N files)` header, and the per-file inventory tables themselves: every test file must have a
row in its section's table, and a row naming a deleted file fails the check. If you add or remove
a test file, update the counts and the table in the same change. `--fix` rewrites counts and
drops rows for deleted files; a new file's row you write yourself, with a real description.

## What runs in CI

Two workflows run on `pull_request`: `unit-tests.yml` and `static-checks.yml`. The rest are push-,
schedule-, or dispatch-triggered and need the bench.

| Workflow | Trigger | Runner | Gates a PR |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| `unit-tests.yml` | `pull_request`, push to `main`, dispatch | GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` | **Yes** |
| `static-checks.yml` | `pull_request`, push to `main`, dispatch | GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` | Reports (see below) |
| `rust-checks.yml` | `pull_request`, push to `main`, dispatch -- **path-filtered** to `box/oscilloscope-daemon/**` | GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` | Reports (see below) |
| `integration-tests.yml` | push to `main`, `workflow_call`, dispatch | self-hosted `lager-bench` | No |
| `update-regression.yml` (Bench: Box Lifecycle) | `workflow_call`, dispatch | self-hosted `lager-bench` | No |
| `nightly-bench.yml` | nightly schedule, dispatch | orchestrator | No |

`nightly-bench.yml` is the only workflow with a schedule; it reaches the other two bench
workflows through `workflow_call`, which is why neither of those carries a `schedule` trigger of
its own.

A job only *blocks* a merge once its status context is listed in branch ruleset 14535039. Seven
contexts are: the six `unit (...)` jobs and `static-checks`. The `compat` and `coverage` contexts
are not.

`unit-tests.yml` runs six matrix jobs, each in its own pytest process, on Python 3.11:

| Job (status context) | Path | Tests |
|---|---|---:|
| `unit (cli)` | `test/unit/cli/` + `cli/tests/` | 1378 (+2 xfailed) |
| `unit (box)` | `test/unit/box/` | 1704 |
| `unit (measurement)` | `test/unit/measurement/` | 105 |
| `unit (blufi)` | `test/unit/blufi/` | 89 |
| `unit (mcp)` | `test/mcp/unit/` | 168 |
| `unit (root)` | `test/unit/test_*.py`, `test/test_*.py` | 127 (+1 skipped) |
| | **Total gated** | **3571** |

Each suite gets its own job because they need incompatible `sys.modules` states for the name
`lager`: `test/unit/measurement/conftest.py` registers a placeholder whose `__init__` never runs
(to skip the heavy box deps), while `test/unit/box/conftest.py` imports the real package. They
cannot share a process.

`unit-tests.yml` also runs a **`compat (pyX.Y)`** job covering the other versions `cli/setup.py`
advertises. It runs all six suites sequentially, one process per version.

`cli/setup.py` declares `python_requires=">=3.10"` and lists 3.10 through 3.14. Coverage today:

| Version | Status |
|---|---|
| 3.10 | `compat (py3.10)` |
| 3.11 | the six `unit (...)` jobs |
| 3.12 | `compat (py3.12)` |
| 3.13 | `compat (py3.13)` |
| 3.14 | `compat (py3.14)` |

**Every advertised version is now covered.** 3.13 and 3.14 were previously absent because
`box/lager/python/service.py` imported `cgi`, which PEP 594 removed in 3.13 -- the box suite could
not even be collected there, and the box's python service would not have started on 3.13 at all.
That file now parses multipart with `werkzeug.sansio.multipart` and `cgi` no longer appears
anywhere in the tree.

`static-checks.yml` covers what pytest cannot reach:

| Check | Scope | Baseline when added |
|---|---|---|
| `bash -n` | 42 shell scripts under `test/` | clean |
| `shellcheck -S warning`, excluding `SC2034,SC2320,SC2155,SC2164,SC2046` | same 42 | clean. Pinned to `shellcheck-py==0.11.0.1`, not the runner image's binary. See below for what the exclusions cost. |
| `compileall` | every `.py` in `cli/ box/ test/ tools/` | clean |
| `pytest --collect-only` | `test/mcp/integration/` | 8 tests collect |
| `ruff --select E9,F63,F7,F82` | `cli/ box/ test/ tools/`, vendored excluded | clean (default ruleset would be ~6300) |
| `coverage` | all six unit suites | ~38%, reporting only, no threshold |

### Rust: `rust-checks.yml`

`box/oscilloscope-daemon` is Rust, and until this workflow **no job in this repo referenced
cargo**. That crate is not a side project: `docker/start-services.sh` launches it on box boot
whenever the binary is present, and `daemon/src/main.rs` opens QUIC/WebTransport listeners on
8082-8084 -- network-reachable runtime code on customer hardware.

The gap was not theoretical. Dependabot PR #172 bumped 20 crates across 22 breaking-version
boundaries, showed a **green tick from twelve checks**, and failed to compile in 74 places --
because all twelve checks were Python. It broke two ways independently:

- `bindgen` 0.69 -> 0.72 made the generated PicoScope FFI bindings unparseable (70 errors)
- `tungstenite` 0.20 -> 0.30 changed `Message::Text` to take `Utf8Bytes` instead of `String`
  (4 errors, at `daemon/src/websocket/handlers.rs:324,385,390` and
  `daemon/src/webtransport/handlers.rs:297`) -- source edits Dependabot cannot make

| Check | Baseline when added |
|---|---|
| `cargo check --workspace --all-targets --locked` | clean |
| `cargo metadata --locked` (lockfile in sync with manifests) | clean |
| `cargo clippy -A clippy::all -W clippy::correctness -D warnings` | 0 findings (full default ruleset is 22) |
| `cargo audit` | 0 vulnerabilities, 3 allowed warnings |
| `cargo fmt --check` | **48 files differ -- reported to the job summary, not gated** |

`cargo check` rather than `cargo build`: it type-checks the workspace without linking, which is
what catches API breaks without resolving every link-time symbol.

It still needs the **PicoScope SDK** on the runner. `daemon/build.rs` runs bindgen against
`/opt/picoscope/include/libps2000/ps2000.h` unconditionally -- no feature flag skips it -- so
without the headers the build script panics and nothing downstream is checked. The first run of
this workflow failed exactly there (`wrapper.h:2:10: fatal error: 'ps2000.h' file not found`).
The job installs `libps2000` from PicoTech's Debian repo, the same one `build_daemon.sh`
documents for setting up a box, and asserts the header exists before continuing.

That makes the job depend on an external apt host. If `labs.picotech.com` proves flaky, split the
job so the SDK-free crates (`cli`, `protocol`, `wtransport_test`) keep gating while the daemon
check degrades to advisory.

The toolchain is pinned to 1.95.0, for the same reason `shellcheck` is pinned in
`static-checks.yml` -- the clippy and audit baselines were measured against a known version, and
`stable` moving would turn this red with no change in the repo.

**`cargo audit` is not redundant with Dependabot.** Dependabot reads the GitHub Advisory
Database; RustSec advisories reach it only once imported. Adding this check surfaced
`RUSTSEC-2026-0204` (invalid pointer dereference in `crossbeam-epoch` 0.9.18) at a moment when
Dependabot reported **zero** open alerts. It is fixed in the same change that added the workflow,
so the step starts clean.

Three advisory *warnings* remain and do not fail the build, because neither has a fixed version
to move to: `rustls-pemfile` unmaintained (`RUSTSEC-2025-0134`, two versions in the graph) and
`anyhow` unsound `Error::downcast_mut` (`RUSTSEC-2026-0190`). Add `--deny warnings` once they
clear.

The `pull_request` trigger is **not path-filtered**: the job detects rust changes itself
(merge-base diff of `box/oscilloscope-daemon/` and the workflow file) and succeeds via skip
when nothing rust-side changed, so it always reports and CAN become a required context. A
Python-only PR pays ~20 seconds of checkout+detect. The job also runs `cargo test
--workspace` -- trivially green until the workspace gains its first test, at which point the
gate exists with no workflow change -- and, on push to main, a release-profile compile smoke
whose binary is uploaded as an artifact (NOT a ship artifact; the deployed daemon is still
hand-built by `build_daemon.sh` against the box's own OS).

### What CI does NOT run

| Area | Size | Why not |
|---|---|---|
| `test/api/` | 82 scripts | Needs real hardware. The bench workflows invoke 8 by name; the other 74 execute nowhere -- though all are now syntax-checked. |
| `test/integration/` | 38 bash scripts | Needs a real box and instruments. One (`communication/jlink_script.sh`) is invoked by `integration-tests.yml`; the rest are syntax-checked and shellchecked but never executed. |
| `test/mcp/integration/` | 1 file | Needs two live boxes. Import-checked only. |
| `test/manual/` | 2 bash scripts | Operator-driven. Syntax-checked only. |
| `cli/tests/test_box_lager_imports.py` | 1 file | Excluded via `cli/tests/conftest.py`: it is a printed report with no `assert` statements, so under pytest its 16 functions pass unconditionally. Still useful run directly. |

Known gaps in the gate itself, in rough priority order:

- **Operating systems.** CI is `ubuntu-latest` only, and six `cli/` modules branch on platform.
  The `termios`/`tty` case is now fixed and guarded (`websocket_client.py` matches the pattern
  `cli/status.py` already used, and `test/unit/cli/test_import_surface.py` simulates the missing
  module with a `meta_path` finder so the guard is exercised on Linux). The remaining platform
  branches are still unexercised -- a real fix needs a `windows-latest` job.
- **No type checking, and no dependency scanning for Python.** There is no
  mypy/pyright/bandit/pip-audit config, so nothing in a PR run inspects Python dependencies.
  Dependabot covers the *alerting* half (`.github/dependabot.yml`), but it runs on GitHub's
  schedule rather than in the gate -- a PR that introduces a vulnerable Python dependency still
  goes green and is caught afterwards, if at all. **Rust is now covered in-gate** by
  `rust-checks.yml`; the Python equivalent is the remaining half.
- **A merged cargo bump does not patch a deployed box.** No workflow builds
  `box/oscilloscope-daemon`, and `box.Dockerfile` does not copy the binary: it is built by hand
  (`./build_daemon.sh`) and mounted from the host at runtime. Fixing a Rust advisory in the
  lockfile is therefore a source-only fix until someone rebuilds and redistributes the daemon.
- **Ruff is errors-only.** It gates real bugs, not style. That floor was chosen because it was
  already clean, and is meant to ratchet up.
- **Five shellcheck codes are excluded from the gate** -- 90 findings, all in `test/integration/`
  and `test/manual/`, which no workflow executes. Detailed below; the ~13 captured-then-ignored
  values in that set are the part that matters.

### The excluded shellcheck codes

`shellcheck` moved from `-S error` (0 findings) to `-S warning` minus five codes. Of the 181
findings `-S warning` reported, 91 are fixed:

| Code | Fixed | What it was |
|---|---:|---|
| `SC2069` | 76 | `cmd 2>&1 >/dev/null` sent stderr to the terminal instead of discarding it. Swapped to `>/dev/null 2>&1`; exit status was never affected, so no test outcome changes. |
| `SC2034` | 33 | `for i in ...` loops whose body never reads the counter, renamed to `for _`. |

**A raw finding count is not a backlog size.** Shellcheck reports `SC2034` once per variable name
per scope, so a file with five unread `i` loops reports one finding until you fix it and the next
surfaces. Fixing 33 loop counters moved the reported count only 45 -> 30, over five passes. The
original "181" was an undercount.

The remaining 90 are excluded by name in `static-checks.yml`. They are excluded there rather than
with inline `# shellcheck disable` comments because a disable directive **cannot be scoped to a
single variable** -- it silences that code for the rest of the file. Ninety inline suppressions
would blind 20 files to everything after them.

| Code | Count | Why still open |
|---|---:|---|
| `SC2320` | 39 | `$?` reads `echo`/`printf`'s status, not the command's. Fixing turns silently-passing checks into real ones. |
| `SC2034` | ~17 | Intentional constants only (BMP280/BME280 register maps, `TEST_DELAY`, a color fallback). The ~13 captured-then-ignored values that used to share this bucket are FIXED -- see below. |
| `SC2155` | 16 | `local x=$(cmd)` masks the command's return value. |
| `SC2164` | 4 | `cd` without `\|\| exit`. |
| `SC2046` | 1 | Unquoted command substitution. |

**The captured-then-ignored values are fixed.** Each was a bench test that computed something and
never checked it; each now asserts (or was deleted where the capture was setup for logic that was
never written):

- `jlink_script.sh` Test 1.3 asserts `SCRIPT_EXISTS` -- previously **both branches of its `if`
  called `track_test "pass"`**, so the test could not fail.
- `debug.sh` gates Tests 14.3/14.4's lenient no-RTT arms on `RTT_SUPPORTED`: a refused RTT
  connection is a real failure when the firmware probe showed RTT working, a warning otherwise.
- `sensors/thermocouple.sh` 11.1 asserts the `OUTPUT_ORIG` baseline read before drawing any
  case-sensitivity conclusion; `infrastructure/generic.sh` 12.5 uses `DEFAULTS_START` as a
  stale-state guard.
- The `OUTPUT1`/`OUTPUT2` keep-cs captures in both `spi_*_manual.sh` suites are checked for
  non-empty, error-free output (calibration bytes vary by chip, so no exact value is assertable).
- `BACKUP_LAGER_FILE`, `TEST_NET_NAME2`, `BACKUP_FILE` were setup for backup/second-net logic
  that was never written: deleted.

The newly honest checks can legitimately fail on the bench where the old ones could not -- that
is the point. `SC2034` stays excluded for the intentional constants; retiring it entirely means
per-file disables for those, tracked as a ratchet follow-up.

## Coverage Gaps

### CLI modules with no gated unit test

Ranked by risk. These are `cli/` modules that no test in the PR gate exercises at all.

| Module | Lines | Why it matters |
|---|---:|---|
| `cli/commands/development/debug/commands.py` | 1475 | The whole `lager debug` group -- flash, erase, reset, RTT state. No tests anywhere. |
| `cli/commands/box/boxes.py` | 773 | `lager boxes` registration, listing, lock/unlock persistence. |
| `cli/commands/measurement/scope.py` + `cli/impl/measurement/scope*.py` | 3221 | Trigger/timebase argument parsing plus a streaming state machine. |
| `cli/commands/measurement/logic.py` | 530 | Logic analyzer; 21 subcommands. |
| `cli/status.py` | 405 | Status/state rendering. Now import-tested (`test_import_surface.py`); the rendering itself is still uncovered. |
| `cli/commands/utility/defaults.py` | 398 | Reads and writes user config defaults -- persistence with no guard. |
| `cli/core/net_storage.py` | 239 | Net definition persistence. |
| `cli/commands/utility/logs.py` | 232 | No tests. |
| `cli/core/ssh_utils.py` | 203 | SSH invocation and argument building. |
| `cli/core/net_group.py` | 200 | Net-scoped click group base class. |
| `cli/context/core.py` | 160 | `LagerContext` construction. |
| `cli/simple_hdlc.py` | 156 | Frame parser / state machine. |
| `cli/update_check.py` | 138 | Background update-check thread. |
| `cli/terminal/**` | ~800 | The whole interactive REPL. |

Sixteen of roughly forty-nine top-level command groups registered in `cli/main.py` have no gated
test: `debug`, `defaults`, `webcam`, `scope`, `logic`, `hello`, `boxes`, `box`, `box-config`,
`dut`, `instruments`, `ssh`, `ssh-setup`, `authorize`, `logs`, `terminal`.
`login`, `logout` and `whoami` are now covered by `test/unit/cli/test_login_commands.py`.

### Defects found by writing the Phase-F tests

Writing coverage for previously-untested modules surfaced five defects. None are fixed in the
test-only change that found them; each is pinned by a test so it cannot regress further or be
"fixed" without the test noticing.

| Where | Defect | How it is pinned |
|---|---|---|
| `cli/core/param_types.py` `CanFrameType.convert` | Tests `'#' in value` **before** `'##' in value`, so a CAN-FD frame always takes the CAN-2.0 branch and dies with `ValueError: too many values to unpack`. The `'##'` branch is unreachable. | `xfail(strict=True)` + a test pinning the exact failure mode |
| `cli/core/param_types.py` `parse_canfd` | Passes `flags=` to the `CanFrame` namedtuple, which has no `flags` field -> `TypeError`, even called directly. So CAN-FD is broken twice over. | same |
| `cli/core/param_types.py` `ADCChannelType.convert` | `'-1'` contains `'-'`, so it takes the range branch and raises a raw `ValueError` from `int('')`. The `value < 0` guard below it is **unreachable dead code**. | test asserts the actual `ValueError`, not the intended `BadParameter` |
| `cli/core/matchers.py` `EndsWithMatcher.feed` | When a chunk ends on `\n`, `split()` leaves a trailing `b''` that is still emitted with its own newline -- so every chunk landing on a line boundary appends a blank line to the user's output. | test pins the exact write sequence |
| `cli/core/matchers.py` `iter_streams` | Line 87 is `elif V1ParseStates.Content:` -- missing `parse_state ==`, so it evaluates an always-truthy enum member. Correct today only because the branches above it are exhaustive; a sixth state would route here silently. | test asserts the source line, and fails once it is fixed |

The three `param_types` defects are all in **export-only** code: the CAN types and
`ADCChannelType` are re-exported by `cli/core/__init__.py` but no command uses them, and no
`canbus` group is registered in `cli/main.py`. They are latent, not user-facing. The two
`matchers` defects are on the live `lager python` output path; the blank-line one is cosmetic and
the `iter_streams` one is currently benign.

Five other param types (`EnvVarType`, `PortForwardType`, `MemoryAddressType`, `HexArrayType`,
`BinfileType`) *are* on live paths -- `lager devenv`, `lager python --env/--port`, `lager debug`
-- and are now covered.

### Undertested -- a test exists, but thin relative to risk

| Module | Lines | Gated coverage | Gap |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `cli/commands/utility/update.py` | 2440 | 14 tests | Only version-ref resolution and the probe. Rollback, staging, service restart untested. |
| `cli/gateway_auth.py` | 376 | 27 tests | Refresh path plus the `cli/tests/` suite. `handle_gateway_denial`, `gateway_response_hook`, `auth_headers_for_box` remain thin. |
| `cli/config.py` | 435 | 63 tests | Cache, the configparser round-trip and legacy-key migration, `read_lager_json`/`write_lager_json`, `expand_devenv_path` and `get_debug_script_for_net` are covered. `get_includes_from_config` and `_find_config_files` are not. |
| `cli/commands/utility/install.py` | 575 | indirect | Only `install_wheel` is exercised. |
| `cli/commands/utility/uninstall.py` | 837 | 13 tests | Spec parsing plus the teardown's lock lifecycle. The privileged sudo session, the `--all` extras and `--dry-run` inspection are untested. |
| `cli/commands/communication/*.py` | — | 1 each | Smoke-only: asserts each posts to `:9000`. `spi.py` (700) and `i2c.py` (551) have no protocol or argument-parsing coverage. |
| `cli/commands/measurement/*.py` | — | 1 each | Same `:9000` smoke pattern. |

### Hardware suite gaps

| Gap | Details |
|-----|---------|
| **Logic Analyzer** | No Python API test. 21 CLI subcommands, bash and MCP coverage only. |
| **SSH / Exec / Install** | No coverage in any hardware suite. |
| **Watt / Energy** | No bash integration tests. |
| **Scope** | No bash integration test. 39 CLI subcommands. |
| **BLE** | No bash integration test. |
| **Box Management** | No Python API tests for boxes, status, or hello. |
| **Rotation / Actuate** | Python API only. |
| **Webcam** | No bash integration test. |

## Coverage Strengths

- **Box-side logic**: 74 files / 1554 tests covering the box HTTP handlers, debug and J-Link
  paths, locking, net persistence, and device drivers -- all hardware-free and gated on every PR.
- **Communication protocols**: I2C and SPI have 18+ Python API files across three hardware
  backends (Aardvark, LabJack, FT232H) with full 3-suite coverage.
- **Power management**: Supply, Battery, Solar, and ELoad all have full 3-suite coverage with
  tolerance checks, boundary tests, and safety teardown, including device-specific suites for the
  Rigol DP821 and the Keithley 2281S.
- **I/O domain**: 17 Python API tests covering ADC, DAC, GPIO, and PWM with real value assertions.
  `test_LabJack_T7.py` is an 11-group suite with env-var configuration, preflight, DAC boundary
  enforcement, stability analysis, and optional loopback.
- **MCP server**: 166 gated unit tests across 11 files, plus an integration suite requiring
  hardware.
- **Regression discipline**: a large share of the box and CLI unit tests are named for the defect
  they pin (`test_uart_bridge_reconnect.py`, `test_dispatcher_channel_resolution.py`,
  `test_gdbserver_zombie_status.py`, `test_jlink_error_masking.py`), each documenting the failure
  in its module docstring.

### Local Unit Tests (`test/unit/` -- 148 files)

#### Box Unit Tests (`test/unit/box/` -- 79 files)

`conftest.py` in this directory imports the real `lager` package once, before any test module is
imported, and stubs the two third-party modules that are neither guarded nor installed
(`flask_socketio`, `pygdbmi`). Without it the suite depends on alphabetical collection order.

| File | What it tests |
|------|---------------|
| `test_acroname_driver.py` | Acroname USB hub driver: contention (bounded session hold, cross-process lock), latency (discovery cache, scan-free warm opens, cycle timing log), and exit cleanup (a parked handle is closed at interpreter shutdown, including through a real subprocess exit) |
| `test_authorized_keys_sync.py` | `start_box.sh` authorized_keys marker-block rebuild (revocation, no duplicates, foreign keys preserved) and its single-instance lock |
| `test_battery_model_authoring.py` | Battery model authoring (create/export of 2281S memory slots), against hardware-verified ground truth |
| `test_bench_quiesce.py` | The quiesce registry that makes a starting job wait for the previous one's teardown, and the arithmetic tying its bounds to the reap they must cover |
| `test_battery_model_catalog.py` | Read-only battery model catalog; the 2281S has no `:BATT:MODel:CATalog?` query |
| `test_binaries_store.py` | `lager.binaries.store` plus the `:9000` `/binaries/*` and `/download-file` handlers |
| `test_box_config.py` | box_config v1 schema validation rules and idempotency hash |
| `test_box_config_addverb_idempotency.py` | mount-add/apt-add/udev-add upsert behavior for provisioning re-runs |
| `test_box_config_cli.py` | `lager box-config` CLI: mount prep, readiness polling, rollback on bounce failure |
| `test_box_dut_cli.py` | `lager dut` CLI detached-list regression fix |
| `test_box_http_server_capabilities.py` | /status capabilities block advertises netCommand based on route registration |
| `test_box_level_command_handlers.py` | Box-level `POST /ble\|wifi\|blufi/command` handlers driving the box's own radios |
| `test_breakpoint_pause.py` | `lager.pause()` interactive breakpoint: timeout handling and resume signaling |
| `test_cleanup_watchdog.py` | Cleanup grace as an *idle* budget: a teardown making progress keeps its deadline pushed out, a wedged one is still cut off, and blocking on an instrument counts as progress |
| `test_custom_devices_assign.py` | `lager.devices.assign` and the `/custom-devices/*` handlers behind `lager nets assign` |
| `test_custom_store.py` | Custom-device JSON persistence: USB cable to catalog instrument mapping |
| `test_da1469x_loader.py` | DA1469x ELF symbol reading, loader path resolution, flash/erase/timeout paths |
| `test_debug_defmt_rtt.py` | Defmt RTT decoding wrapper threading and piping logic, plus the down-channel `write()` that makes a decoding session bi-directional — including the late write that must not reopen the telnet port it just released |
| `test_debug_net_self_heal.py` | DebugNet self-heal retry and session endpoints |
| `test_debug_net_user_scripts.py` | User-script/slot helpers: OpenOCD/J-Link base64 fields and serial in debug_net.py |
| `test_debug_rtt_reconnect.py` | J-Link RTT reader reconnect-aware socket handling across J-Link restart |
| `test_detect_and_configure_rtt.py` | RTT control-block RAM scan doesn't leave core halted in all-stop mode |
| `test_device_lock.py` | Cross-process advisory fcntl lock preventing USB-TMC pyvisa race |
| `test_diagnose_jlink_parse.py` | Box-side J-Link diagnose parsers, pinned with captured JLinkExe text |
| `test_dispatcher_channel_resolution.py` | `resolve_channel`: v0.32.0 regression where int()-only parsing broke named adc/dac channels |
| `test_gdb_controller_leak.py` | GdbController close on failed attempts to prevent fd leak |
| `test_gdbserver_zombie_status.py` | Defunct/zombie gdbserver detection that a bare `os.kill(pid, 0)` check passes |
| `test_hardware_service_fail_fast.py` | `/invoke` fail-fast locking and hang recovery: per-device and per-address locks answer `device-busy` rather than queueing behind a wedged `open_resource`, and a hung driver call expires into `invoke-timeout` plus a supervised restart |
| `test_hardware_service_retry.py` | Close-then-recreate retry path for concurrent Keithley resource collisions |
| `test_host_ops.py` | apt_install and sysctl_apply SSH execution branches |
| `test_hub_lock_fail_fast.py` | The same treatment on the USB hub path: bounded waits on the module-level and per-hub locks (`hub-busy`), a per-operation deadline (`hub-op-timeout`), the restart that follows, and the state sweep's per-hub sub-budget (clamp + `hub-skipped`) |
| `test_jlink_commander_use_poll.py` | JLinkExe spawned with use_poll=True to avoid fd >= 1024 select() failure |
| `test_jlink_error_masking.py` | Three debug-path defects that masked on-bench J-Link failures |
| `test_jlink_memrd_reset_halt.py` | DA1469x reset+halt-before-read gating, regression guard, env-var opt-out |
| `test_jlink_multi.py` | Multi-probe start_jlink_gdbserver with per-probe serial/port/RTT configuration |
| `test_jlink_multi_gdbserver_select.py` | Multi-probe GDB slot dispatch |
| `test_jlink_script_attach_retry.py` | A user `.JLinkScript` defining `InitTarget()` replaces J-Link's built-in, which is what brings the DAP up on a blank or protected part; the attach retries once without the script rather than wedging the net |
| `test_jlink_script_scoping.py` | J-Link scripts are per net: an operation with no net gets none, a net never inherits another's script, and a session's script is cleared when it ends |
| `test_jlink_uncached_verify.py` | DA1469x opt-in uncached QSPI post-program verify to detect false XIP failures |
| `test_lager_package_identity.py` | Guards this suite's conftest invariant: `lager` must be the real on-disk package with its `__init__` executed, not a placeholder |
| `test_labjack_batch_read.py` | `POST /labjack/batch_read`: locks on the same device identity `/invoke` does, and writes nothing to the instrument |
| `test_load_box_secrets.py` | `load_box_secrets()` returns `{}` on every failure, which makes an unreadable secrets file indistinguishable from a box with none configured -- pins that distinction |
| `test_lock_state.py` | lock_state.py single source of truth for box-side lock behavior |
| `test_logic_net_type.py` | `lager logic`'s workers must resolve nets under `NetType.from_role(LOGIC_ROLE)`; `Net.get` matches on type equality, so a mismatch is a silent no-op rather than an error |
| `test_net_ready.py` | `wait_for_net`: polling a net through the re-enumerate / hardware-service-restart window, deadline honoured without overshoot, probe selection, and a progress callback that cannot break the wait |
| `test_monitor_state.py` | SupplyNet/KeithleyBattery single-call monitor-state helpers reducing lock contention |
| `test_mount_prep.py` | Mount preparation SSH operations via mocked runner |
| `test_net_command_handler.py` | Generic POST /net/command Flask handler dispatch by role and error handling |
| `test_net_save_uart_identity.py` | `usb_identity_for_net_record`: durable USB identity snapshot at UART net save time |
| `test_nets_display.py` | `lager nets` table no-truncation for long UART pins and VISA addresses |
| `test_nets_safety_limits_endpoint.py` | `/nets/safety-limits`: reading and writing a net's voltage/current ceilings |
| `test_nets_state_endpoint.py` | `GET /nets/state`: wedged-instrument resilience, per-instrument probing, LabJack cross-role batch routing through hardware_service (no USB contention), I2C bus scan, and the request deadline handed to the USB batch as a per-hub budget |
| `test_openocd_dispatch.py` | OpenOCD interface .cfg dispatch and user-cfg override behavior |
| `test_probes_visa_parsing.py` | VISA address parsing for empty-serial FTDI probes |
| `test_python_kill.py` | `/python/kill` signals every PID in a job, once per process group, and shares one grace window across the whole set; real forked children, not mocks |
| `test_python_service_breakpoint.py` | Breakpoint endpoints on box python/service.py POST routes |
| `test_python_service_multipart.py` | `parse_multipart` after the move off `cgi.FieldStorage`: byte-exact binary fields, repeated names, and the `.py`/`.zip` to BytesIO rule |
| `test_python_service_nets_list.py` | GET /nets/list handler returning saved net array or empty on missing/invalid JSON |
| `test_render_docker_args.py` | Sourceable bash output preserves docker-run args through array expansion |
| `test_render_packages.py` | pip/cargo/npm renderers preserve only their own config fields and soft-fail gracefully |
| `test_rtt_handlers.py` | Bi-directional RTT over the `/rtt` WebSocket namespace: read loop, J-Link banner stripping, shutdown cleanup, and the three ways a held RTT port is freed — a departed client (which the loop's own heartbeat cannot detect), a wedged reader, and the port-keyed guard that keeps two channels of one net independent |
| `test_safety_interlock.py` | Per-net voltage and current ceilings enforced on instrument commands |
| `test_secret_file_ownership.py` | The ownership block extracted verbatim from `box/start_box.sh`: mode 0600 grants the OWNER alone, so a secrets file owned by the host login user locks the container runtime out of its own secrets |
| `test_serial_id_cables.py` | tty enumeration and resolution via fake /sys tree lookup |
| `test_ssh_runner.py` | SSH key selection and auth fallback logic |
| `test_ssh_setup.py` | `lager ssh-setup` command and SSH key provisioning with TTY passthrough |
| `test_stream_disconnect.py` | `peer_is_connected` and the idle tick that let the box notice a vanished client in under a second instead of waiting for the script's next write |
| `test_stream_teardown.py` | `lager python` child reaped when the client disconnects mid-run, instead of orphaning at 100% CPU holding a device flock |
| `test_sudoers_contract.py` | The `/etc/sudoers.d/` ownership contract: Lager writes exactly three files there, never globs and never touches the directory itself, and every writer — including the shell copy in `setup_and_deploy_box.sh` — emits the banner telling an operator those files are regenerated wholesale. Also pins the recorded escalation posture: the box login user is root-equivalent by design, and no source may claim a scoped entry confines it |
| `test_supply_command_handler.py` | `POST /supply/command` handler, covering v0.32.0 hardware-found regressions |
| `test_uart_bridge_reconnect.py` | UARTBridge re-enumeration healing after an adapter changes its /dev/tty node |
| `test_uart_session_cleanup.py` | Websocket UART read loop heals in place instead of stopping on a failed read |
| `test_usb_devices_dfu.py` | `GET /usb/devices` sysfs enumeration and `POST /usb/dfu` list/download/detach argument building |
| `test_usb_scanner_custom.py` | Custom-device surfacing in box HTTP scanner GET /instruments/list. Also the SuperSpeed companion dedupe: one physical dock lists as one instrument, and a missing bus root pairs nothing rather than pairing everything. |
| `test_usb_scanner_uart_fallback.py` | UART enumeration without USB serial by matching sysfs path; two identical adapters keep distinct ttys and the channel catalog stays unmutated |
| `test_webcam_detection.py` | sysfs-based webcam detection (`_by_camera`) against a fake sysfs tree |
| `test_plugable_driver.py` | Plugable RTS5411 dock driver: USB hub-class per-port power switching over pyusb -- ganged/no-switching hubs refused without touching a port, a disable NOT judged by device presence (the kernel cannot see a disconnect while a port is unpowered, so the sysfs node persists), cycle restoring power on every failure path and reporting re-enumeration, off-time range enforced before any transfer, SuperSpeed companion pairing refused when ambiguous, network-device and inter-hub-link guards, one-session batch reads, handle disposal on every path |
| `test_ykush_driver.py` | YKUSH USB hub driver: device-contention regression from an indefinitely cached handle |
| `test_automation_exports.py` | Static parse of `automation/__init__.py`'s lazy export table: no name guarded twice, every returned driver reachable under its own name, everything in `__all__` resolvable -- the copy-paste class of defect that made one driver answer to another's name |

#### CLI Unit Tests (`test/unit/cli/` -- 56 files)

| File | What it tests |
|------|---------------|
| `test_address_utils.py` | IPv4/IPv6/Tailscale/hostname validation rejecting schemes, ports, and paths |
| `test_battery_tui.py` | BatteryTUI render output, command parsing, and worker thread offloading |
| `test_binaries_9000.py` | `lager binaries add/list/remove` and `download_file` migrated to the box HTTP server on `:9000` |
| `test_box_command_error.py` | `box_command_error`: a 404 that means "net or instrument not found" must not also tell the user their box image is out of date |
| `test_box_lock_helpers.py` | Lock holder resolution, acquire/release/heartbeat, `LockSession.dissolve`, and format_lock_user CI support |
| `test_box_request_failure_messages.py` | `echo_box_request_failure`: distinguishing a slow box-side op from a dead box |
| `test_box_ssh_identity.py` | Admin commands offer the `lager_box` key with keyless fallback (probe, pool, install/uninstall); key registration under `/etc/lager/authorized_keys.d`, de-registration on `uninstall --all`, and install's password-fallback removal |
| `test_configure_docker_dns.py` | `configure_docker_dns`: daemon.json `dns` entries must be bare IPs or Docker refuses to start |
| `test_configure_docker_dns_rollback.py` | Rollback behaviour of `configure_docker_dns.sh` when the DNS optimization fails |
| `test_debug_flash_erase_reconnect.py` | `lager debug flash`'s default erase step: no reconnect between `/debug/erase` and `/debug/flash`, a failing `/debug/connect` cannot abort the flash, and the command's verdict follows the programmer's own output rather than reporting "Flashed!" unconditionally |
| `test_debug_service_client_auth.py` | Gateway auth on the debug service client |
| `test_devenv_config_commands.py` | `lager devenv mount` / `env`: editing project-local `.lager` volumes and environment keys |
| `test_devenv_terminal_docker_args.py` | `docker run` args for `devenv terminal` and `exec`; regression for the `--group` bare-flag bug |
| `test_docker_start_limit.py` | The installer must not trip docker.service's `StartLimitBurst=3`: one service start per step, `reset-failed` before every restart, and `start-limit-hit` diagnosed as itself rather than a bad daemon.json |
| `test_diagnose_classify.py` | `lager diagnose` classification decision tree for one-line user diagnosis |
| `test_diagnose_classify_jlink.py` | `lager diagnose` J-Link classification from `/diagnose/usb` + `/diagnose/jlink` payloads |
| `test_diagnose_classify_usbhub.py` | `lager diagnose` USB hub classification from `/diagnose/usbhub`, including the wedged hub that sysfs and lsof both call healthy Also that an unsupported hub vendor gets its own permanent-state classification instead of the transient BUSY one, which told people to rerun when idle for a condition that never changes. |
| `test_error_mapping.py` | map_system_error errno mapping [16/19/110] to actionable headlines and actions |
| `test_gateway_auth_refresh.py` | Gateway-auth refresh margin scaling with token lifetime -- pins the refresh-storm fix |
| `test_gdbserver_interactive_rtt.py` | `gdbserver --rtt --interactive`: the flag is rejected without `--rtt`, the streaming leg moves to the `/rtt` WebSocket, and plain `--rtt` still uses the HTTP stream |
| `test_net_9000_migration.py` | Tier-1 net CLI commands (adc, dac, gpi, gpo, spi, i2c, watt, energy, ...) driving the box `:9000` API |
| `test_net_tui_assign.py` | Custom-device assignment TUI helpers; per-device uart tty preference over the shared channel map |
| `test_net_tui_labjack_pins.py` | TUI LabJack pin dialog preserving legacy channels or persisting custom params |
| `test_net_tui_uart_guard.py` | UART net save validation rejecting bare interface indices and empty pins |

| `test_nets_debug_scripts.py` | Smart `lager nets set-script` auto-detection and probe/file reconciliation |
| `test_nets_state_display.py` | `lager nets state` State column rendering, including the dash shown for a net whose state is unknown |
| `test_nets_tui_startup.py` | Nets TUI startup regressions: mixed net types, empty state, unsaved placeholders |
| `test_performance_improvements.py` | Config caching, connection pooling |
| `test_python_auto_lock.py` | `lager python` auto-lock wrapper idempotency, atexit, and heartbeat thread |
| `test_python_breakpoint_session.py` | Breakpoint client request shapes for continue_python/breakpoint_status endpoints |
| `test_python_stop_signals.py` | `lager python` stop handlers cover SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP on both registration paths, and restore every one; asserts real signal dispositions rather than recorded calls |
| `test_resolve_box_locked.py` | `resolve_box_locked`: acquires an ephemeral lock on resolution, stashes the release on the context, passes through under `LAGER_AUTO_LOCK_DISABLE`, and reports `already_ours` for a lock we already hold. Pins the holder via `get_lock_holder` and forbids real HTTP, so the result cannot depend on whether it runs on a laptop or a CI runner |
| `test_ssh.py` | SSH ensure_lager_box_keypair and key_auth_works helpers |
| `test_supply_tui.py` | SupplyTUI render output, command parsing, worker threads, connection failure |
| `test_uart_ws_status_events.py` | CLI handling of box-side `uart_status` events when a UART device re-enumerates |
| `test_update_deps_preview.py` | `lager update --check`'s build-cache line never promises a cached build the rebuild gate would override — a pending layout flatten is a certain rebuild, and an unmeasurable build hash is reported as unknown rather than as a valid cache |
| `test_update_flatten.py` | `lager update` sparse-checkout flatten: deletions propagate, root entries preserved, and the docker-build hash covers the source tree |
| `test_update_probe.py` | `lager box update` probe script modprobe/usbtmc detection and output parsing |
| `test_update_secret_ownership.py` | `lager update`'s secret-file ownership repair, run as real shell against a throwaway directory with a recording `sudo` stub |
| `test_usb_command_errors.py` | `lager usb <net> <command>` error wiring: a 404 for a missing device must not be reported as an out-of-date box image |
| `test_usb_cycle_command.py` | `lager usb <net> cycle|recover` wiring: off-time reaches the box, no client-side default that could drift from the box's, and the client budget outlasts the longest legal cycle |
| `test_version_skew.py` | Version skew warning when CLI minor > box minor with per-process caching |
| `test_watt_subcommands.py` | `lager watt` NetGroup reading power/current/voltage/all over the box API |
| `test_ws_diagnose.py` | WebSocket failure message generation pointing to instrument vs. box based on health |
| `test_box_lock_command.py` | `lager boxes lock`/`unlock` command layer: the no-expiry reservation body (`holder_type`/`ttl_seconds`), exit codes on 409/403, `--force`, and the Docker-root warning |
| `test_config_roundtrip.py` | `cli/config.py` JSON<->ConfigParser round-trip, legacy-key migration, `read`/`write_lager_json`, `expand_devenv_path`, `get_debug_script_for_net` |
| `test_impl_host_importable.py` | Every `cli/impl/*` module must import with `box/` off `sys.path` and `lager` blocked -- they ship in the wheel but the box tree does not, so a module-level `import lager` breaks them on any pip install |
| `test_import_surface.py` | Import guards: `cli/status.py` needs pymongo's `bson.decode`, and `termios`/`tty` must stay optional (simulated via a `meta_path` finder) |
| `test_login_commands.py` | `lager login`/`logout`/`whoami`: display-name fallback, MFA prompt wiring, logout URL rstrip, and the four `whoami` session states |
| `test_matchers.py` | Test-output matchers and the v1 stream framing parser; markers split across chunk boundaries must still set the exit code |
| `test_param_types.py` | Every custom click ParamType, valid and invalid, incl. the five on live command paths |
| `test_safe_unpickle.py` | Deserialization allowlist: refused globals must not be imported as a side effect of refusing them |

#### Measurement Unit Tests (`test/unit/measurement/` -- 4 files)

| File | What it tests |
|------|---------------|
| `test_joulescope_cache.py` | JS220 close-vs-instance-cache coherence; the warm `/net/command` path bug |
| `test_joulescope_serial.py` | JS220 location parsing and serial-number device matching on the warm path |
| `test_ppk2_unit.py` | PPK2 pure logic: location parsing, dispatcher routing, singleton caching, read math |
| `test_watt_reads.py` | Watt-meter current/voltage/all reads, the shared SI formatter, and the averaging window |

#### BluFi Unit Tests (`test/unit/blufi/` -- 2 files)

| File | What it tests |
|------|---------------|

| `test_blufi_scan.py` | `BlufiClient.scan()` BLE advertisement presence checks |

#### Root Unit Tests (`test/unit/test_*.py` -- 7 files)

| File | What it tests |
|------|---------------|
| `test_coverage_checker.py` | `tools/check_coverage_counts.py`: platform-gated rows are not drift (and `--fix` must not rewrite them), plus the anchored summary parse `FORCE_COLOR` defeated |
| `test_group_usage.py` | Usage-line formatting for CLI command groups (CommandFirstUsageMixin / LagerGroup) |
| `test_install_wheel.py` | install-wheel command: wheel filename to package name parsing |
| `test_no_global_os_path_patches.py` | Tree-wide guard: no test may patch `os.path` (process-global; on Python >= 3.14 it also rewrites every `pathlib.Path.exists()`) — patch the module's seam or use a real temp path |
| `test_pdf_pages.py` | `tools/pdf_pages.py`: PNG and text extraction (skips without pymupdf, which is AGPL) |
| `test_uninstall_spec.py` | Pins `lager uninstall`'s removal spec to what `install` / `box-config apply` actually create; lock dissolves when the teardown removes the lock server |
| `test_update_version_ref.py` | Version reference resolution for git checkouts (semver tags vs. named branches) |

#### Repo-Root Unit Tests (`test/test_*.py` -- 2 files)

| File | What it tests |

| `test_format_lock_user.py` | `box_storage.format_lock_user` rendering of lock holder identities |

#### In-Package CLI Tests (`cli/tests/` -- 7 files)

Gated as part of the `unit (cli)` job.

| `test_update_gate.py` | Update rebuild gate: probe parsing, build-hash mismatch, early-exit verdict | Yes |
| `test_gateway_callsites.py` | Gateway-auth discovery across every box-talking call site: record the mapping on a discovery 401, retry once with a held token, surface genuine denials, and keep rendering the other boxes' rows | Yes |
| `test_host_cli.py` | Host-OS CLI install helpers shared by `lager install` and `lager update`: the reconcile decision table, `--check` labels, exit codes, the probe snippet under a real shell, and the drift guard pinning the deploy scripts' mirror | Yes |

## How to Run

### Unit tests (no hardware)

Run each suite as its own pytest invocation, exactly as CI does. `PYTHONPATH` must include the
repo root and `box/`; `--import-mode=importlib` keeps same-named modules in different suites from
colliding; `-c /dev/null` stops `test/mcp` from shadowing the `mcp` PyPI package.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD:$PWD/box"
PYTEST="pytest -v --import-mode=importlib -c /dev/null --timeout=60"

$PYTEST test/unit/cli/ cli/tests/
$PYTEST test/unit/box/
$PYTEST test/unit/measurement/
$PYTEST test/unit/blufi/
$PYTEST test/mcp/unit/
$PYTEST test/unit/test_*.py test/test_*.py
```

Do **not** run `pytest test/unit/` as a single command: `test/unit/box/` and
`test/unit/measurement/` install incompatible `lager` packages into `sys.modules` and cannot share
a process. Running them together fails with a message from `test/unit/box/conftest.py` saying so.

Dependencies: `pip install -e cli/` plus `pip install -r test/requirements-unit.txt`.

That file's ten entries carry major-version caps so an upstream major cannot turn a required
context red with no change in this repo. The **floors stay deliberately low**, because the same
file feeds the compat matrix and pip resolves differently per interpreter -- `numpy` lands on
2.2.6 for 3.10 but 2.4.6 for 3.11 and 2.5.1 for 3.12, so a floor pinned to whatever 3.11 resolved
would break `compat (py3.10)`. Verify any floor change against the oldest version in the matrix:

```bash
pip install --dry-run --ignore-installed --only-binary=:all: \
    --python-version 3.10 --target /tmp/x -r test/requirements-unit.txt
```

### Hardware suites

```bash
# Python API tests (on real hardware, via the box)
lager python test/api/power/test_supply_comprehensive.py --box <YOUR-BOX>

# Bash integration tests (from host)
./test/integration/power/supply.sh <BOX> <NET>

# MCP integration tests (requires two boxes)
pytest test/mcp/integration/ -v --import-mode=importlib -c /dev/null \
    --box1 <YOUR-BOX> --box3 <YOUR-BOX>
```
