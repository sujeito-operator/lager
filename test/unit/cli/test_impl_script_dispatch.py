"""
Every impl script a command dispatches to must exist in the installed package.

`run_backend(ctx, box, "<script>.py", action, ...)` couples a command to a file
by a bare filename string. Nothing imports these scripts -- they are read off
disk and uploaded to the box -- so no import test, linter or type checker can
see a name that resolves to nothing.

Sixteen `lager logic` subcommands dispatched to `measurement.py`, `trigger.py`
and `cursor.py`, none of which are in the tree, and `get_impl_path` returned the
root-directory path without checking it existed. The commands failed with a bare
`ValueError` raised much later, after the box had been resolved and the net
validated, so it looked like a box problem.

This walks the call sites the way the CLI does and asserts each name resolves.
It fails on a new dispatch to a script nobody added, and on a script deleted out
from under a dispatch that still references it.
